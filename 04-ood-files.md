## Open OnDemand (OOD)

**Open OnDemand (OOD)** is a web-based interface to Hyak Klone and Tillicum that provides a **graphical alternative to the command line**. It is especially useful when working with tools or workflows that benefit from a graphical user interface (GUI).

You can access **Hyak Klone’s Open OnDemand** instance at:  
👉 **https://ondemand.hyak.uw.edu/**

You can access Tillicum’s Open OnDemand instance at:  
👉 **https://tillicum-ood.hyak.uw.edu/**

## When Should You Use Open OnDemand?

Open OnDemand is the **recommended way** to use applications that are designed around a GUI, including:

- **Jupyter notebooks**
- **VS Code**
- **RStudio**
- Other interactive or desktop-style applications

OOD is also helpful if you prefer to:
- Navigate the filesystem by **clicking through directories**
- Quickly **view outputs**, such as plots or images
- Download small files (e.g., figures, logs, results)

## Access Notes

If accessing from **off campus**, you may need to connect to the **UW VPN**. [Follow the steps below to establish your connection](./04-ood-files.md#establishing-your-connection-to-the-university-of-washington-vpn).

## File Management in OOD

OOD includes a graphical file browser that allows you to:
- Click through directories instead of using `cd` and `ls`
- Open and preview files
- Download files directly to your local machine

This can be convenient for **quick inspection** of results, such as viewing plots generated by a job. Many users switch between both depending on the task—and that’s exactly how it’s intended to be used.

> **Limitations:**  
> While downloading small files works well, OOD is **not well suited for large uploads or transfers**. For sharing or moving large datasets, we strongly recommend using **Globus**, which we [**demonstrate separately**](./05-file-transfer.md).
